# ScrumJET - Online Training Course Website 🚀

ScrumJET is a collaborative group assignemnt project developed by a Scrum team of Computer Science students. Our mission is to create a user-friendly, minimalist, and aesthetically pleasing commercial website for a popular Online Training Course business. This platform is envisioned to advertise and sell Scrum and other computer science-related certification and non-certification courses via the internet or specific training centers.

This project is our response to a brief set by Dr S.X. Laurence, who acts as our Product Owner, guiding us with a specification of core features to include in the new site.

## Project Methodology 📝

Our team applies the Scrum methodology, which organizes our work into manageable 'sprints' to streamline workflow and productivity. Each week, we held a 1-hour timeboxed sprint planning/review meeting where we review and prioritize user stories/features from our product backlog. Our Scrum Master rotates weekly, ensuring that all team members gain experience in this key role.

## Tech Stack 💻

- **Front-end**: HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
- **Back-end**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite

## Features 🎁

Our application is a work in progress, but here are the core features we aim to deliver:

- User-friendly and minimalist interface designed for easy navigation.
- Comprehensive online courses in Scrum and other computer science-related topics.
- Course delivery via the internet or at specific training centers.
- An integrated Learning Management System (LMS).
